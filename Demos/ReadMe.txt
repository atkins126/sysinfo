Demo Programs for the PJSysInfo unit.
=====================================

There are two demo programs, one in each of the VCL and FMX directories. Both
demos display the result of calling every method of TPJComputerInfo, TPJOSInfo
and TPJSystemFolders along with the values of all the Win32xxxx global
variables.

1) VCL Directory

   The demo in the VCL directory compiles as a VCL program.

   This demo has been designed to be backward compatible with Delphi 4 and,
   later but this is not guaranteed. The current version has only been tested
   with Delphi XE, 11 and 12 using Windows 11 Version 23H2.

   Some unsupported form properties may need to be removed when opening the
   project's form in earlier compilers, but this should do no harm.

   Some compilers need some extra steps to be taken in order to compile the
   program:

   * For Delphi 2006 and earlier you need to manually create a Win32 sub-
     directory of the VCL directory to receive the output binaries.

   * Delphi 2007 cannot understand the project file. Delete the .dproj file and
     open the .bdsproj file instead.

   All supported compilers will output a Windows 32 bit program by default, in
   the Win32 sub-directory.

   Delphi XE2 and later can also create a 64 bit version of the program if the
   Windows 64 bit target is selected.

   ** BUG **
   64 bit programs are output to the Win32 sub-directory, not the Win64 sub-
   directory as may be expected. This bug is not being fixed because doing so
   **could** make that the project file incompatible with earlier Delphi
   versions.

2) FMX Directory

   This directory contains a demo program that compiles for the FireMonkey 2
   framework.

   The demo was initially created using Delphi XE3 and updated using Delphi XE4.
   It is believed that the demo is compatible with Delphi XE3 through to Delphi
   11, but it has only been tested with Delphi 11 & 12 using Windows 11
   Version 23H2.

   When loaded into the IDE of Delphi version other than Delphi XE4, certain
   form properties may be reported as missing. Ignoring such properties should
   enable the form to load and the program to compile and run successfully. This
   is the case with Delphi 10.4 and 11.

   Both 32 bit and 64 bit Windows targets are supported, with 32 bit being the
   default. Binaries are written to the Win32 or Win64 sub-directories
   respectively.

## Note about manifests ##

At least for Windows 10/11, TPJOSInfo returns different results depending on
whether the host application is manifested to be compatible with that OS (this
is a Microsoft "feature", no matter how ridiculous we may find it).

Because of this each of the demo apps has a .manifest file that is included in
its resources by means of a {$R 'Manifest.res} directive in the app's project
file. To see how the values returned from TPJOSInfo methods change when there is
no manifest simply comment out the {$R 'Manifest.res'} line and recompile.
